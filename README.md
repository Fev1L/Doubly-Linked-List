# Doubly Linked List

### Description
This project implements a doubly linked list in C++. A Doubly Linked List is a data structure where each element (node) contains references to both the next and the previous elements, allowing efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations.

### Features
- Add elements to the front and back of the list.
- Remove elements by value.
- Search for elements in the list.
- Display the list forward and backward.
- Clear the entire list.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fev1L/Doubly-Linked-List.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Doubly-Linked-List
   ```

### Run
1. Compile the code using g++:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o doubly_linked_list
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./doubly_linked_list
   ```


### Project Structure
- `main.cpp` — Example usage of the doubly linked list.
- `DoublyLinkedList.h` — Class declaration for the doubly linked list.
- `DoublyLinkedList.cpp` — Implementation of the class methods.

### Requirements
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++).

### Feedback
If you have any ideas or suggestions for improving the project, feel free to open a new Issue or make a Pull Request.
